1,3cb215f9-6429-4486-9f84-9a1aa7fe8acc,MS,PPMS,hydroxychloroquine,Hydroxychloroquine for Primary Progressive Multiple Sclerosis.,"Primary progressive multiple sclerosis (PPMS) does not respond well to immunomodulatory or immunosuppressive treatment. Chronic activation of microglia has been implicated in the pathophysiology of PPMS. The antimalarial drug hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) reduces the activity of human microglia and has neuroprotective effects in vitro. We conducted a single-arm, phase II futility trial of 200mg oral HCQ twice daily for 18months. In an effort to investigate disability worsening in the absence of overt focal inflammation, we excluded participants with contrast enhancing lesions on a screening magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The primary end point was ?0% worsening on the timed 25-foot walk measured between 6 and 18months of follow-up. Based on original trial data, 40% of the cohort were expected to worsen. We used a Simon 2-stage design to compare a null hypothesis of 40% of the cohort worsening against the one-sided alternative of 20%. Using a 5% type 1 error rate and 80% power, HCQ treatment would be deemed successful if fewer than 10 of 35 participants experienced clinically significant worsening. The study met its primary end point, as only 8 of 35 participants worsened between 6 and 18months. HCQ was overall well-tolerated, with adverse events in 82% and serious adverse events in 12% of participants. All serious adverse events were unlikely related to HCQ use. HCQ treatment was associated with reduced disability worsening in people with PPMS. HCQ is a promising treatment candidate in PPMS and should be investigated further in randomized controlled clinical trials.

We tested the hypothesis that treatment with pioglitazone reduces new lesion development in patients with RRMS. Twenty-two patients were treated with pioglitazone or placebo and monitored by diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) at baseline and after 12 months. A negative correlation was found between the 1-year change in relative anisotropy (RA) and fluid attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) lesion burden in the pioglitazone group. Regions of interest (ROIs) having high ADC and low RA values at baseline had a significantly higher chance to develop into lesions in the placebo group than similar ROIs in the pioglitazone group. These findings suggest that baseline DTI parameters can provide a prognostic surrogate marker for lesions, and that pioglitazone can reduce conversion of normal appearing white matter to lesions",,2010,,Effects of pioglitazone on diffusion tensor imaging indices in multiple sclerosis patients,,interventional,Phase II,,31,4,2,19,0.792273382,3.543154276

It is therefore conceivable that pro-energetic and antioxidant drugs such as alpha-lipoic acid might delay the onset or slow down the progression of the disease. In a previous study, 600mg alpha-lipoic acid was given daily to nine patients with AD (receiving a standard treatment with choline-esterase inhibitors) in an open-label study over an observation period of 12 months. The treatment led to a stabilization of cognitive functions in the study group, demonstrated by constant scores in two neuropsychological tests (the mini mental state exam, MMSE and the Alzheimer's disease assessment score cognitive subscale, ADAScog). In this report, we have extended the analysis to 43 patients over an observation period of up to 48 months. In patients with mild dementia (ADAScog < 15), the disease progressed extremely slowly (ADAScog: +1.2 points/year, MMSE: -0.6 points/year), in patients with moderate dementia at approximately twice the rate. However, the progression appears dramatically lower than data reported for untreated patients or patients on choline-esterase inhibitors in the second year of long-term studies. Despite the fact that this study was not double-blinded, placebo-controlled and randomized, our data suggest that treatment with alpha-lipoic acid might be a successful 'neuroprotective' therapy option for AD. However, a state-of-the-art phase II trial is needed urgently",12576,2007,,alpha-Lipoic acid as a new treatment option for Alzheimer's disease - a 48 months follow-up analysis,https://ecrf1.clinicaltrials.ed.ac.uk/camarades/a72d4d36-563f-484d-8b7d-412488b13ff5/publications/ms clinical trial/journals/4443_hager2007.pdf,interventional,Phase III,,33,4,1,20,0.833986477,3.438614337

However pioglitazone has anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective effects, reduces glial and T-cell activation, and reduces signs in an animal model of multiple sclerosis (MS). We tested the effects of daily treatment with pioglitazone in a small cohort of relapsing remitting MS patients. RRMS patients taking IFNbeta-1alpha and having an EDSS score <6.5 were randomized to treatment with pioglitazone (30 mg daily, p.o.) or placebo and monitored clinically and by MRI for 1 year. Primary outcomes were safety and tolerability, secondary outcomes included changes in neurological outcome, lesion burden, and gray matter volume. After 1 year 11 patients in the pioglitazone arm and 10 in the placebo arm completed the trial. Pioglitazone was well tolerated with a similar incidence of non-serious adverse events in placebo and treatment groups. After 1 year there were no significant differences in clinical symptoms as assessed by EDSS; however MRI showed a significant reduction in gray matter atrophy, and a trend for reduced lesion burden in the treatment group. These results show that pioglitazone was well tolerated in RRMS patients with indications of beneficial effects, warranting further trials to establish clinical efficacy",,2009,,A pilot test of pioglitazone as an add-on in patients with relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis,,interventional,Phase II,,25,4,2,11,0.459014645,2.052775898

Myelin in the CNS is a specialised extension of the oligodendrocyte plasma membrane and clemastine fumarate can stimulate differentiation of oligodendrocyte precursor cells in vitro, in animal models, and in human cells. We aimed to analyse the efficacy and safety of clemastine fumarate as a treatment for patients with multiple sclerosis. We did this single-centre, 150-day, double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled, crossover trial (ReBUILD) in patients with relapsing multiple sclerosis with chronic demyelinating optic neuropathy on stable immunomodulatory therapy. Patients who fulfilled international panel criteria for diagnosis with disease duration of less than 15 years were eligible. Patients were randomly assigned (1:1) via block randomisation using a random number generator to receive either clemastine fumarate (5路36 mg orally twice daily) for 90 days followed by placebo for 60 days (group 1), or placebo for 90 days followed by clemastine fumarate (5路36 mg orally twice daily) for 60 days (group 2). The primary outcome was shortening of P100 latency delay on full-field, pattern-reversal, visual-evoked potentials. We analysed by intention to treat. The trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT02040298. Between Jan 1, 2014, and April 11, 2015, we randomly assigned 50 patients to group 1 (n=25) or group 2 (n=25). All patients completed the study. The primary efficacy endpoint was met with clemastine fumarate treatment, which reduced the latency delay by 1路7 ms/eye (95% CI 0路5-2路9; p=0路0048) when analysing the trial as a crossover. Clemastine fumarate treatment was associated with fatigue, but no serious adverse events were reported. To our knowledge, this is the first randomised controlled trial to document efficacy of a remyelinating drug for the treatment of chronic demyelinating injury in multiple sclerosis. Our findings suggest that myelin repair can be achieved even following prolonged damage.

Elevated levels of pro-inflammatory mediators and some oxidative stress parameters can accelerate the demyelination process. We aimed to investigate the efficacy and safety of metformin as an adjuvant therapy to interferon beta 1a (IFN尾-1a) in relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS) patients. Eighty RRMS patients were equally divided into 2 groups: the intervention group receiving IFN尾-1a plus 2 gm of metformin once daily and the control group receiving IFN尾-1a alone. Interleukin 17 (IL17), interleukin 22 (IL22), malondialdehyde (MDA), T2 lesions in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and expanded disability status scale (EDSS) were assessed at the baseline and then after 6 months. At baseline, there were no statistically significant differences between the two groups (p??.05). After 6 months, the change in the median (interquartile range) of the results for both the intervention and control group were; IL17 (-1.39 (4.19) vs -0.93 (5.48), p??.48), IL22 (-0.14 (0.48) vs -0.09 (0.6), p??.53), and EDSS (0 vs 0, p??), respectively. The mean (standard deviation) change in MDA for the intervention and control group was -0.93 (2.2) vs -0.5 (2.53), p??.038, respectively. For MRI results, 21 patients had stationary and regressive course and 1 patient had a progressive course in the intervention arm vs 12 patients had stationary and regressive course and 4 had a progressive course in the control arm, p??.14. Adding metformin to IFN尾-1a demonstrated a potential effect on an oxidative stress marker (MDA). However, there is no statistically significant effect on immunological, MRI and clinical outcomes. We recommend larger scale studies to confirm or negate these findings.
